How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Using any feedback thats given by users helps to make sure that you are making what they want in a product. Having "user stories" gives a big help to developers to ensure what they are working on and intergrating into the project is what is wanted in the end product.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I hope to use a lot of the processes when developing programs. Planning is a big must I feel for me to be successful as well as continuous testing at all stages to make sure bugs are found and fixed before the end.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Having great communication of what you have been doing as well as taking accountability for your work. Also being transparent with the team about what help you might need and making sure to pull your weight in the project.
